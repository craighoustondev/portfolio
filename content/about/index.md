I consider myself to be a Product Engineer. I love listening and speaking to users in order to properly understand their problems and collaborate with them to iterate on solutions.

I have worked in software delivery since 2010. I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer for <a href="https://legl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Legl</a>, a legal-tech startup that helps law firms digitise and automate core business operations like payments, onboarding and AML compliance.

Prior to this I have worked on learning management systems, renewable energy systems and veterinary practice management systems.

I live in rural South West Scotland, which has been home for almost all of my life. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

## My values

To paraphrase <a href="https://markmanson.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Manson</a>, values are, by definition, a belief that something is good or desirable and worth striving for, regardless of context or circumstance.

I recently embarked on a journey to define the values that I hold dear. This is a never-ending journey and these values are subject to review and change, but I have listed the things that I currently value. I plan to write about this in more detail in the near future.

### Humility

Whilst I am all for celebrating success, I like to fully understand the true importance and value of something before doing this publicly and ensure that praise is shared fairly.

I am opinionated on certain topics but I don't always assume that I am right and welcome challenge in order to validate my thoughts.

### Empathy

I strive to see things from the perspective of others, particularly users of the software I help deliver.

I try to communicate in a way that is clear to all and adapt the details to my audience.

### Collaboration

I love to collaborate with others and default to this way of working where it makes sense. I take careful consideration of the downstream effect of doing something in isolation.

### Fairness

I value making space for diverse opinions and perspectives. I have lost count of the number of times a junior engineer has offered a counterpoint that has forced me to rethink my opinion.

## Interests

Whilst software delivery takes up a lot of my time, it doesn't consume my entire life. My other interests include:

* 👨‍👩‍👧 Spending time with my wife and daughter
* 🎸 Playing guitar - I have previously played in "pub bands" but more recently I just play for my own benefit
* 🎵 Going to gigs - I love listening to music at home but there's nothing quite like watching a band at the top of their game in the flesh
* ⚽ Football - I have played regularly my entire adult life but these days I am mostly consigned to watching on TV
* 🐕 Walking Dusty, my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
